# The fault in our stars (slight spoiler)

## Why I recommend this book

The plot is NOT as cliché as many other love stories filled with intensive crying, fighting and even vigorously dying in the name of love. Provided cancer at young ages, the characters were well aware of the last day, and it somehow presents me a feeling (by the tongue of the female character) where time proceeds and life progresses even I have a deep grief for my loved one. It is such a resonant feeling in most peoples’ life (I guess) - at least it reminded me of my grandma’s pass-away. 

My feelings had been ‘manipulated’ by the plots, and my mind was quite enjoying. My emotion was building up by the Netherland fantasy, and then dropped steeply with the strongest disappointment (ever in the book), in which characters got grumpy after they found out the author of a best-ever-in-life book is too much of a jerk to match a sympathetic being living in the imagination. There are more than the mentioned plots that would bring you joyfulness, sadness, calmness (plus more my words failed to enumerate). 

If you are a reader full of sympathy, the book would help you pick up faded memories. If you were hurt deeply from a relationship, the book would comfort you in a way to never loose your faith in love even you will experience foreseeable death (killed by cancer alike). One of my favorite verdicts was printed on the book cover, quoted “You laugh. You cry. And you come back for more”.  Indeed, I’d come back for more with an uplifting spirit. Yes, this piece of art offers uplifting spirit, disguised by a sadness husk. Isn’t it a genius?

## Sparkling moments/best quote

- The journey literally began at the Author’s Note. Can not help myself duplicating as below:
    
    > Neither novels nor their readers benefit from attempts to divine whether any facts hide inside a story. Such efforts attack the very idea that made-up stories can matter, which is sort of the foundational assumption of our species.
    > 
    
    It is such a brilliant way of setting the tone. Though much appreciated to author’s honest, there is also foundational assumption on the basis of FACTs. Thank you John, but species including me could not resist to find interior rational whatever slim benefit might be received. Yet more species were trying to search ‘An Imperial Affliction’ in the real world, though it is a made-up book in this book.
    
- The appearance of the male character (i.e., Gus) has an irresistible sense of crooked behaviors to teenage girls (I could simply guess since I’m a male). For me, the most ‘ingenious’ Gus behavior is always the moves to take out a cigarette from a pack, followed by him putting it between the lips WITHOUT lighting.
    
    This sort of reminded me of the high school days, when ‘crooked’ boys were smoking vigilantly, trying to hide away from school teachers. Gus did it in a new level. First of all, he did not light up the cigarette or pretend being cool by smoking (although he might pretend to be cool by acting differently, but acceptable given the age). Secondly, Gus did it (or John Green composed so) for his reason - a ‘metaphor’ (quote below).

- I hate to provide further sneak-peek as I promised this would be a slight spoiler. Therefore, snatch the book and start reading.

## Things I don’t quite understand

- Why the book was named after “the fault in our stars”?
    
    `Or does it matter to comfort my rational mind (considering Author's notes)?`
