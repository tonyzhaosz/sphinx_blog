# Software Security Development Jotting

Multiple roles involved in the security development lifecycle (SDL in short). The following content focuses on software designing, development and testing.

#### Design Architect

##### Character responsibilities

* Identify and document each interfaces of the product, including physical and logical interfaces. This may also be known as `Threat Modeling`. Regarding security, the following is worth noting: 
    1. List security implications and trust boundary per interface.
    2. List possible threats or constrains per interface.
    3. Identify access control to each interface, like whether it needs authentication.

* The concept of defence in depth involves multiple layers of defences. If one layer is compromised, other layers should be able to prevent the system from complete compromise.

#### Software Security Development

Requirements --> Design --> Development --> Testing --> Deployment --> Maintenance

##### Software security requirements

* Legal security requirements.
* Customer security requirements and technical requirements

##### Designing secure software

`Thread modeling` please refers to related topics in `iot-security.md`.

The following aspects could be considered during threat modeling:
    * Attacker-centric: attacker motives and techniques are well understood.
    * Software-centric: provides a service like stock data.
    * Asset-centric: select if sensitive data are processed.

Recall concepts in `iot-security.md`. Some application security principles are listed here:
    * Attack surface reduction.
    * Secure defaults. NOT leave insecure settings in place for the components and services of your application, and design your app to use the most secure settings by default.
    * Least privileges.
    * Defence in depth.
    * Compartmentalization (divide into sections or categories). Could design trust boundaries to isolate components from one another.

##### Security development lifecycle

Tools to be used in SDL (in Microsoft):
    * Threat-modeling tool like MSTT to identify threats early in the Design phase.
    * Fault-injection tool to aid with security testing efforts in the Verification phase.
    * Code analysis like static analysis and binary analysis.

Code review in terms of security:
    * OWASP code review guide.
    * SE top 100 security rules.
    * Compile-time and run-time fault injection like `Fuzz testing` uses an automated tool that provides invalid or random input to an application and monitors how the application behaves.


##### Security code review

Best practices:
    * Identify the scope of the code review.
    * Break code review into chunks.
    * Review code iteratively.
    * Set time limits.
    * Create coding standards.

Control flow analysis (what code is executed under what conditions) and data flow analysis (what code handles what data).

Review for unique issues:
    * Look for custom security code.
    * Look for code that uses cryptography.
    * Review authentication and authorization models.

Security risk management basics:
    * Vulnerability: Weakness in the application.
    * Exploit: An application or set of commands to take advantage of vulnerability, like hack into an application. A valid phrase is `exploit vulnerabilities`.
    * Countermeasure: A step taken to `address` or `reduce` the potential for damage caused by a vulnerability in your application code.
    * Risk: The potential for loss or damage to an asset (like a database).

#### OWASP 2017 Mitigation

OWASP: open web application security project.

##### Mitigating injection

SQL injection is one of the most common example of injection. For instance, a URL may be used to check SQL database by something like https://example.com/showosders?customer-id=224 `or 1`. The `or 1` is injected to the normal URL, and could bypass custer-id checking.

##### Mitigating broken authentication

It talks more on session management and password recovery.

##### Mitigating sensitive data exposure

The issues in sensitive data exposure involves insecure crypto storage and insufficient transport layer protection.

Handshake algorithm:
    * Have to determine whether or not you require `perfect forward secrecy`.
    * Handshake with perfect forward secrecy: ECDHE.
    * Handshake without perfect forward secrecy: ECDH.
    * Notice performance may vary case-by-case.

Authentication algorithm:
    * ECDSA and RSA could be selected.
    * The choice is largely dictated by Certificate Authority that issues the cert.
    * ECDSA has better performance, especially combined with ECDHE (Ephemeral).


Best practices to handle TLC certs:
    * Never use self-signed cert.
    * No MD5 hashing.
    * Use RSA or DSA key > 2048 bits


#### Development of secured embedded software

Some memory issues:
    * Buffer overflow
    * Double free
    * Use after free
    * Invalid memory pointers
    * Out of range access
    * Memory leaks
    * Using uninitialized memory

#### Vulnerability scan

* Sometimes scanners even report vulnerabilities where none are present called a false positive.
* When a scanner failed to find an existing vulnerability, it is called a false negative.

#### Various attacks in C/C++ code

* Format string attacks: 
    For formatting output, the C standard provides functions that take a variable number of arguments, called variadic functions. These are the `printf`, `sprintf`, and `fprintf` family of functions. They allow you to supply a format string and a variable number of arguments that the function will apply the format string to. This allows you to control how data is written to the output stream by specifying a variety of formatting options. Due to the limitations in the way the variadic functions are implemented, vulnerabilities can occur when the format string is under user control.

    Interestingly, different specifiers (e.g., `%x`, `%n` and `%s`) of sprintf could result in different vulnerabilities. 

* String handling
    The `strlcat`, `strlcpy` functions were written as safer alternatives to `strncat` and `strncpy` and guarantee null termination. Unlike `strncpy`, `strncat` also guarantees the resulting string is null terminated. The only function that does not guarantee this in all cases is `strncpy`.

#### IoT Web Interface

There may be something technical terms involved: Cross-site scripting (XSS), Cross-site request forgery (CSRF), SQL injection and Command injection. Knowing the basics would be enough.
